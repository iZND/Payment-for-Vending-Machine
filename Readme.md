# Raspberry Pi Setup for Payment Gateway and Automatic Dispensing

This guide explains how to set up a Raspberry Pi to interface with a payment gateway and trigger the dispensing process upon successful payment notifications (e.g., via QR code).

---

## Prerequisites

### Hardware
1. Raspberry Pi (e.g., Raspberry Pi 3/4).
2. MicroSD card (16GB or larger).
3. Power supply for the Raspberry Pi.
4. Monitor, keyboard, and mouse (for initial setup).
5. PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) to control the dispensing system.
6. Required cables/connectors for communication between Raspberry Pi and PLC.

### Software
1. Raspberry Pi OS installed on the microSD card.
2. Node.js and npm.
3. Stripe account for payment processing (or equivalent payment gateway).
4. Stripe CLI for testing (or equivalent testing tools).

---

## Step 1: Prepare the Raspberry Pi

### Install Raspberry Pi OS
1. Download the Raspberry Pi Imager from [raspberrypi.com](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
2. Flash the Raspberry Pi OS onto the microSD card.
3. Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi and boot it up.

### Initial Configuration
1. Open the Raspberry Pi Configuration tool:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
2. Perform the following configurations:
   - Enable SSH for remote access.
   - Configure Wi-Fi or Ethernet settings.
   - Set the hostname (e.g., `payment-vending-pi`).
   - Enable interfaces like GPIO, SPI, or Serial if needed for PLC communication.

### Update the System
Run the following commands to ensure the system is updated:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

## Step 2: Install Required Software

### Install Node.js and npm
Install Node.js and npm:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

### Install Git
Install Git for version control and repository management:
```bash
sudo apt install -y git
```

### Clone the Repository
Navigate to the home directory and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iZND/Payment-for-Vending-Machine.git
cd Payment-for-Vending-Machine
```

### Install Project Dependencies
Install the required Node.js packages:
```bash
npm install
```

---

## Step 3: Configure the Webhook Handler

### Set Up Environment Variables
1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory:
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```
2. Add the following configurations (replace placeholders with actual keys):
   ```env
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
   PLC_PROTOCOL=modbus  # Example: Replace with your PLC protocol
   ```

### Test the Webhook Server
1. Start the webhook handler server:
   ```bash
   node Webhook_handler-Script1.js
   ```
2. Use the Stripe CLI to forward test events to the server:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook
   ```

---

## Step 4: Connect Raspberry Pi to the PLC

### Determine the Communication Protocol
- Identify the protocol supported by your PLC (e.g., Modbus RTU, Modbus TCP, GPIO, or Ethernet).

### Physical Connection
- Connect the Raspberry Pi to the PLC using the appropriate interface (e.g., GPIO pins, serial connection, or Ethernet cable).

### Install Protocol Libraries
- If using Modbus, install the `modbus-serial` library:
  ```bash
  npm install modbus-serial
  ```

### Implement PLC Signal Logic
1. Edit the `sendSignalToPLC` function in the code to send signals to the PLC:
   ```javascript
   const ModbusRTU = require('modbus-serial');
   const client = new ModbusRTU();

   function sendSignalToPLC(value) {
       client.connectRTUBuffered("/dev/ttyUSB0", { baudRate: 9600 })
           .then(() => client.writeRegister(1, value))
           .then(() => console.log('Signal sent to PLC'))
           .catch(console.error)
           .finally(() => client.close());
   }
   ```

---

## Step 5: Automate the System

### Run the Webhook Server on Boot
1. Create a systemd service to run the webhook handler at startup:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/payment-vending.service
   ```
2. Add the following content:
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Payment Vending Webhook Service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /home/pi/Payment-for-Vending-Machine/Webhook_handler-Script1.js
   Restart=always
   User=pi
   Group=pi
   Environment=PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
   Environment=NODE_ENV=production
   WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/Payment-for-Vending-Machine

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
3. Enable and start the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable payment-vending
   sudo systemctl start payment-vending
   ```

### Monitor the Service
Check the status of the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl status payment-vending
```

---

## Step 6: Test the Entire System

### Simulate a Payment
Use the Stripe CLI to simulate a successful payment:
```bash
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

### Verify Dispensing
Confirm that the Raspberry Pi sends a signal to the PLC and the dispensing mechanism is triggered.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Webhook Server Not Running**:
   - Check the status of the systemd service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status payment-vending
     ```
   - Restart the service if necessary:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart payment-vending
     ```

2. **PLC Communication Issues**:
   - Verify the physical connection between the Raspberry Pi and the PLC.
   - Check the protocol configuration in the `sendSignalToPLC` function.

3. **Stripe Webhook Signature Error**:
   - Ensure the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in the `.env` file matches your Stripe settings.

# Webhook Handler for Stripe Payments

This project implements a webhook handler using Node.js to process Stripe payment events. It listens for Stripe webhook events, validates them, and processes successful payment events to send signals to a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller).

## Features
- Listens for Stripe webhook events on a specified endpoint.
- Validates incoming webhook events using Stripe's signature.
- Processes `checkout.session.completed` events to handle successful payments.
- Sends a signal to a PLC with the payment amount.

## Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Stripe Account**: You need a Stripe account to obtain your API keys and webhook secret.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install the required dependencies:
4. Replace the placeholders in the script with your actual Stripe keys:
   - `your_stripe_secret_key`: Your Stripe secret key.
   - `your_webhook_secret`: Your Stripe webhook secret.

## Running the Script
1. Start the server:
2. The server will start listening on port `4242`.

## Testing the Webhook
1. Use the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) to forward events to your local server:
2. The server will start listening on port `4242`.

## Testing the Webhook
1. Use the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) to forward events to your local server:
2. Trigger a test event using the Stripe CLI:
## How It Works
1. The script listens for POST requests on the `/webhook` endpoint.
2. It validates the incoming request using the `stripe-signature` header and the webhook secret.
3. If the event type is `checkout.session.completed`, it extracts the payment amount and sends a signal to the PLC using the `sendSignalToPLC` function.

## Code Overview
- **Dependencies**:
  - `express`: For creating the server and handling HTTP requests.
  - `body-parser`: For parsing raw JSON payloads.
  - `stripe`: For validating and processing Stripe webhook events.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `sendSignalToPLC(tokens)`: Sends a signal to the PLC with the payment amount.

## Notes
- Ensure your firewall or antivirus software does not block port `4242`.
- This script assumes the payment amount is in cents and converts it to dollars before sending it to the PLC.
